#summary Configure the list of available workflows
<h1>Configure the list of available workflows<h1>

= Introduction =

The list of available workflows can be configure easily :
  # Write an workflow, using OSWorkflow syntax [http://www.opensymphony.com/osworkflow/documentation.action OS Workflow Documentation]
  # Write the file to describes parameters and users rights (cf [DescribeWorkflowRightsAndParameters])
  # Configure the available workflows thanks to a file that links the two files

= Details =

So as to configure the list of workflows that will be available in the all application, you should create *one or more* file of type "workflowlist" in the folder specified in _WORKFLOWLIST_CONFIGFILE_FOLDER_ of module config file (cf [BasicConfigurationOfTheModule]).
(New > Structured content > List of Workflows)
 
When you edit a file of this type, you get the following window:

You have to create as instance as workflows you want to allow access (for this, use the green plus available when clicking on the target).
For each instance you need to define :
  * *Title* : the name of the workflow
  * *Description* : the description that will be displayed in front of the name when create an instance of workflow
  * *WF File* : the path of the XML workflow description file (OSWorkflow language).
  * *WF Rights* : the path of the XML workflow configuration file. This file contains the description of the user rights and of the initial parameter of the workflow. (cf next section)
